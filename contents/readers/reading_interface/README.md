 # Reading Manifold

 ### What to expect
 What does documentation for the Manifold reader look like? When you open up a book on Manifold, you have many options for the look of your reading interface. This documentation is here to help. How do I change the font? Where do my notes go? How do I skip to the next chapter? Manifold strives to make your digital reading experience straightforward and to aid your digital note-taking and citation. As a reader, you will have your own sense of how a digital text works and how it fits into your regular work flow. These features do some of the work for you without imposing on your personal preferences.

 ## The Reading Interface

 ### [Annotation](contents/readers/annotation.md)

 ### [Bookmarks](contents/readers/bookmarks.md)

 ### [Comments](contents/readers/comments.md)

 ### [Citation](contents/readers/citation.md)
 Thanks to CLS, you can export citations in any number of formats. Whether you are quoting a passage or referencing the whole text, you can find citation information ...

 ### [Resource Notation](contents/readers/resource_notations.md)

Resources operate differently. You find resources on your project home page. Since these can be any number of things (not always text), notation works differently.

 ### Sharing Texts (I'm not actually sure how this works...)
