# Reading Interface 

### Getting Started

What does documentation for the Manifold reader look like? When you open up a book on Manifold, you have many options for the look of your reading interface. This documentation is here to help. How do I change the font? Where do my notes go? How do I skip to the next chapter? Manifold strives to make your digital reading experience straightforward and to aid your digital note-taking and citation. As a reader, you will have your own sense of how a digital text works and how it fits into your regular work flow. These features do some of the work for you without imposing on your personal preferences.

## The Reading Interface

Once you login, you have the opportunity to read with features dedicated to your own work. Clicking into a project lands you at the first pages of the text. You may click through from start to finish, or navigate to the contents to jump directly to the chapter most pertinent to your needs. 

You may change the look of the interface itself. At the top right of the menu, in addition to your personal account icon, you will see an eye icon and "Aa". The "<o>" lets you reveal or hide your comments/highlights/annotations. The "Aa" takes you to a menu of formatting options to customize your reading. You may enlarge the text, choose serif or sans serif font, invert the color (black on white or white on black text), and increase or decrease the margins.

Within the text, you may use your cursor to [share](share.md), [annotate](annotation.md), or highlight(highlight.md). A menu appears when you click over the text. 

### [Annotation](annotation.md)

When you highlight text, you are given the option to annotate. Your comments are available when you are logged in. 

### [Bookmarks](bookmarks.md)

### [Citation](citation.md)

You can export citations in any number of formats (e.g. MLA, Chicago, APA, etc.). Whether you are quoting a passage or referencing the whole text, you can retrieve citation information by highlighting and choosing "Share" in the hover menu. The citation option allows you to choose your format and copy the text to your clipboard.

### [Resource Notation](resource_notations.md)

Resources are not necessarily straight text a You access resources from each project home page. Since these can be any number of things (not always text), notation works differently.

### [Comments](comments.md)
