# Reading Interface
## Getting Started
What does documentation for the Manifold reader look like? When you open up a book on Manifold, you have many options for the look of your reading interface. This documentation is here to help. How do I change the font? Where do my notes go? How do I skip to the next chapter? Manifold strives to make your digital reading experience straightforward and to aid your digital note-taking and citation. As a reader, you will have your own sense of how a digital text works and how it fits into your regular work flow. These features do some of the work for you without imposing on your personal preferences.

## The Reading Interface
Once you login, you have the opportunity to read with features dedicated to your own work. Clicking into a project lands you at the first pages of the text. You may click through from start to finish, or navigate to the contents to jump directly to the chapter most pertinent to your needs.

You may change the look of the interface itself. At the top right of the menu, in addition to your personal account icon, you will see an eye icon and "Aa". The "<o>" lets you reveal or hide your comments/highlights/annotations. The "Aa" takes you to a menu of formatting options to customize your reading. You may enlarge the text, choose serif or sans serif font, invert the color (black on white or white on black text), and increase or decrease the margins.

From the Project page, you can "Start Reading," which will open from the title page, or you can go to "Contents," to see linked chapter titles and section headings. You can turn pages by clicking "Previous" or "Next" buttons at the bottom of each page or by selecting the linked heading under "Next."

You may also return to Project Home, Projects overview, or Following by the top left "Menu" tab. The top "Contents" tab will open the table of contents in a slide navigation bar on the left. Clicking again will close the contents menu. This means you can look at the contents without losing your place on the page.

Endnotes within the text are linked so that you may go from text to notes and back without scrolling.

Within the text, you may use your cursor to [share](share.md), [annotate](annotation.md), or highlight(highlight.md). A menu appears when you click over the text.

### [Annotation](annotation.md)
When you highlight text, you are given the option to annotate that portion of the text, either for your own private review or as an element of public discourse. Your annotations are available when you are logged in.

### [Citation](citation.md)
You can export citations in three different styles (i.e., Chicago, MLA, and APA). Whether you are quoting a passage or referencing the whole text, you can retrieve citation information by highlighting and choosing "Share" in the hover menu. The citation option allows you to choose your format and copy the text to your clipboard.

### [Comments](comments.md)
Unlike Annotations, Comments are strictly public and refer to responses to public Annotations.

### [Resource Notation](resource_notations.md)
You access Resources from each project home page or from any text annotated with them. Since Resources can be any variety of media (not always text), notation works slightly differently.
