# Annotation
When logged into Manifold, you have a number of note-taking options. First, use your cursor to highlight the text you wish you to annotate. A menu will appear asking if you wish to Share, Annotate, or Highlight.

Selecting Share opens two further options: Cite and Twitter. The Cite option will allow you to copy and cite the text formatted according to either Chicago, MLA, or APA style. (If certain metadata is missing from a Text, the Cite option will not appear.) "Twitter" opens another tab in your browser window directed to Twitter. If you are logged in, it will automatically populate your tweet with an image and links back to the point you highlighted in the text. Otherwise Manifold will fill the template and offer an option to sign in or sign up on Twitter.

With Annotate, you can write notes which Manifold will save for you. You may choose to make your annotations private by selecting the tick box below the field where you type in your notes. If you leave your annotation publicly it can be [commented](comments.md) on by other readers who are logged in.

Highlight lets you highlight text. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the eye icon in the top right menu. A green eye icon shows both annotations and highlights from all users, a gray icon shows none—not even your own—and a blue icon shows only your the highlight and annotations you have personally supplied.

Once you have clicked "Save," your notes will be attached to that project. When you return to the Project home page, you will find a counter indicating both how many highlights and how many annotations you have added to the project.
