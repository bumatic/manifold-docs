# Annotation

When logged into Manifold, you have a number of note-taking options. First, use your cursor to highlight the text you wish you to annotate. A menu will appear asking if you wish to share, annotate, or highlight.

"Highlight" lets you highlight text. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the eye icon in the top right menu.

"Share" gives you options of "[Cite](citation.md)" or "Twitter." The "cite" option will allow you to copy and cite the text. "Twitter" opens another tab in your browser window directed to twitter. If you are logged in, it will automatically populate your tweet with an image and links back to the point you highlighted in the text. Otherwise Manifold will fill the template and offer an option to sign in or sign up on Twitter.

With "Annotate," you can write notes which Manifold will save for you. You may choose to make your annotations private by selecting a box below the field where you type in your notes.

Once you have clicked "Save," your notes will be attached to that project. When you return to the Project home page, you will find a counter indicating both how many highlights and how many annotations you have added to the project.
