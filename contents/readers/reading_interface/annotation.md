# Annotation

When logged into Manifold, you have a number of note-taking options. First, use your cursor to highlight the text you wish you to annotate. A menu will appear asking if you wish to share, annotate, or highlight.

"Highlight" lets you highlight text. You may read with your highlights turned on or off, by clicking the eye icon in the top right menu.

With "Annotate," you can write notes which Manifold will save for you. You may choose to make your annotations private by selecting a box below the field where you type in your notes.

Once you have clicked "Save," your notes will be attached to that project. When you return to the Project home page, you will find a counter indicating both how many highlights and how many annotations you have added to the project.
