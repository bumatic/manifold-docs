# Resource Notations
Each Resource in the system has its own page whereon you can comment and discuss the Resource publicly (comments to Resources cannot be made private). These comments will remain within your account when you return to the text and reopen the Resource. Each comment has options to "Reply," "Edit," "Delete," or "Flag."

Resources may also be shared by clicking the Twitter widget on the right of the Resource page, which will link back to the Manifold project.

If available for redistribution, resources may be downloaded by clicking the download button in the right hand column, just below the image and above the metadata.
