# Comments
Unlike Annotations, Comments are strictly public and refer to responses to public annotations. Each comment is saved to the project and is associated with the account that created it. Comments can themselves be replied to and are set off visually from those they are responding up through four levels of nesting. After the fourth level responses to comments aren't visually distinct, but replies are always possible, regardless of how deep a conversation may go. Additionally, comments can be edited by those who created them, deleted, or flagged as inappropriate. 

Comments can be made on project resources. See [resource notations](resource_notations.md) for more information.
