# Share

When you highlight text in Manifold, you will see the option to "Share." "Share" offers two options -- "Cite" and "Twitter." 

"Share" gives you options of "[Cite](citation.md)" or "Twitter." The "cite" option will allow you to copy and cite the text. "Twitter" opens another tab in your browser window directed to twitter. If you are logged in, it will automatically populate your tweet with an image and links back to the point you highlighted in the text. Otherwise Manifold will fill the template and offer an option to sign in or sign up on Twitter.

See [Citation](citation.md) for more on citation.
