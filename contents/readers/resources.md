# Resources
Manifold expands scholarly books in many ways. Importantly, Manifold makes available and portable a collection of relevant resources that support the primary manuscript. Research and data collected by the author may be published alongside the text in different file formats.

Readers can find the resources from the [project page](project_page.md).

When logged in, readers can also write notes on these collected resources (see [Resource Notations](resources_notations.md)).
