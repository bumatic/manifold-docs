# Project Page

## Overview

When you log into your Manifold account, you will see two main display options in the top left menu: [Projects](## Projects) and [Following](## Following). Projects in Manifold operate as containers the way books do on a shelf -- only in Manifold, they contain not only the main text but also supplemental resources beyond the scope of print appendices. The Project Page acts as a bookshelf view of the contents of your Manifold library. These items may be viewed on Projects which offers a selection of [Featured Projects](## Featured Projects) at the top of the page. Scrolling below Featured Projects, you will find a catalog of [Our Projects](## Our Projects), which displays the full library available on Manifold through the Press. 

## Projects

## Following
The Following page allows you to keep track of those books you choose from the Press's catalog. You may add and remove projects as you wish.

## Adding Projects

By clicking the "+" icon, you may add titles to your personal project library. If you select the "Following" option from the top menu, your projects will be displayed. If you hover your cursor over the select check mark, you will see you have the option to unfollow projects -- you will be asked to confirm before the action happens.

On the main project menu, you will also notice that books you already follow have a different mark than those which you may add.
