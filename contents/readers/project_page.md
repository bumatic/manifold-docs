# Project Page

## Overview

When you log into your Manifold account, you will see two main display options in the top left menu: [Projects](## Projects) and [Following](## Following). Projects in Manifold operate as containers the way books do on a shelf -- only in Manifold, they contain not only the main text but also supplemental resources beyond the scope of print appendices. The Project Page acts as a bookshelf view of the contents of your Manifold library. These items may be viewed on Projects which offers a selection of [Featured Projects](## Featured Projects) at the top of the page. Scrolling below Featured Projects, you will find a catalog of [Our Projects](## Our Projects), which displays the full library available on Manifold through the Press.
