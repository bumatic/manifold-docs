# Copyright and Permissions
## Introduction
It is the author’s responsibility to obtain permission for the use of material copyrighted by others. Because obtaining permission often takes several weeks or months, we urge you to send out permission requests as early as possible. Keep records of all correspondence. If you are unable to contact the rights holder of a particular piece of copyrighted material for permission to reprint, consult with your publisher regarding the best course of action. **All** permissions should accompany the materials they are associated with when submitted to your publisher. **This is a test**

## Ethical Concerns
Reproducing materials from any community involves more than just legal precedent. Please be aware of and sympathetic to any mores the peoples and cultures with whom you are working hold with regard to your research and publishing plans. Be open, honest, and precise in your discussions with what you want to use and the means by which you intend to distribute it—in print, online, open access, etc. Don't assume you can use materials without offense, or that permission to use them in one way suggests permission to use them in others without being specifically cleared to do so.

## Determining Whether Permission Is Required
There are many gray areas in copyright law, especially as regard fair use, and your publisher will have its own distinct set of standards under which it operates. With that in mind, the following sections will be useful in reviewing your materials:

### General Guidelines
*	Anything _published_ before 1923 is in the public domain and can be used freely.
*	Materials created before 1923 _but never before published_ may still be in copyright.
*	Materials that are freely available in public spaces (e.g., murals, statues, materials on the Internet) are **not**, simply because of their location, in the public domain. The standard criteria that applies to other works applies equally to them.
	*	*Exception*. Pictorial representations of architectural works that have been constructed do not require permission from those involved in the designing or building of the structure; instead you will only require the permission of the photographer.
*	If you are securing materials from an archive or museum, there are two distinct forms of permission in play: (1) copyright and (2) access. The former speaks to legal code, the latter to that particular institution's guidelines in allowing access to use or reprint materials in their keeping. Work with archivists and reference librarians in ascertaining what kinds of permissions, if any, you'll need for the materials you are interested in reproducing.
	*	In some cases materials may have been donated under conditions that limit how they can be used.
	*	Similarly, an institution can limit your access to representations of works of art, even those that are in the public domain. Gaining access to those materials generally requires the permission of the housing agent.

### Journal Articles or Book Chapters
If any of your chapters have been previously published in journals or anthologies (or contributed volumes), you must seek permission to reprint the material unless it has been *extensively* revised for republication. For example:
* A revised piece that follows the same thread of an argument but is simply abridged for republication or expanded to reflect new research or ongoing developments **requires permission.**
* Use of the most substantive, vital portions of a previously published piece, even if the sections are relatively short **requires permission.**
* Culling small amounts of material from a previously published work to advance a new line of thought **does not require permission.**
* Use of material that could be considered peripheral to the published piece, and which does not constitute a major portion of the new piece, **does not require permission.**

### Prose Passages
Quotations from newspaper articles or other works of prose that are not the work of the author require permission if what is quoted amounts to more than 10 percent of the whole.

### Poetry and Song Lyrics
Quotations from lines of poetry or song lyrics do not require permission as long as what is quoted is only two to four lines (or ten seconds of playing time transcribed) and never more than 10 percent of the whole.

### Unpublished Works
Permission is required from the rights holder for any amount of unpublished archival materials quoted, such as private correspondence and manuscripts.

### Unpublished Interviews
*	Be they audio, video, or transcribed, you may need permission from your institution's interview review board (if applicable) and the interviewee(s). Some publishers will require written confirmation from each party, others only your confirmation that all parties were agreeable to your use of the material. You will also need consent from any party who taped, recorded, or transcribed the sessions in question. If you are not reproducing direct quotes or have altered/obfuscated the names of those interviewed, formal permission may not be necessary. Check with your publisher on how best to proceed.

### Photographs
Photographs other than the author’s own require permission. Exceptions are screen captures and promotional publicity stills for films, which are considered fair use under the justification that they are small parts of a much larger whole. If there is a credit line or copyright notice to the publicity photo, your publisher *must* be consulted and will determine if it requires permission. Fair use *does not* apply to photographs of staged performances. Permission for material from websites follows the same guidelines as material from printed sources unless the content is explicitly designated as open access or public domain.

### Artwork
Artwork, including paintings, drawings, and comics, require permission. Artwork produced prior to 1923 is considered public domain, but the author must abide by any agreement signed to gain access to the work.

### Ephemera
Advertisements, posters, interior pages of newspapers or magazines, book and magazine covers, album art, and fliers will be considered fair use when reproduced in their entirety. No cropping can occur.

### Tables, Diagrams, Charts, Maps, and Graphs
Visual representations of data are considered fair use as long as there is not a strong artistic element to the works, which will be determined by your publisher.

## How to Request Permission
### Letter of Request
Send two copies of a permission request letter (see Appendix C for a sample letter) to each copyright holder, indicating the material for which you are requesting permission. Specify that you are seeking nonexclusive world rights in all languages and ask that your request be handled as quickly as possible.

### Grants of Permission
Originals of all letters you receive granting permission, as well as letters returned by the post office as nondeliverable, **must** be sent to the Press with your final manuscript submission. In addition, maintain records of all e-mails and letters sent and phone calls made in the process of obtaining permission.

### Fees
Unless otherwise agreed upon, you are responsible for paying all permissions fees.

## Securing and Submitting Permissions
## Permission Requests
Including materials on Manifold requires permission from rights holders to `reproduce material in both print and electronic formats throughout the world for the life of the project.`

This language effectively asks that rights holders provide you permission to use their material in your project regardless of the medium in which it is presented and so long as the project is supported throughout the world. Removing territory, term, and medium restrictions is imperative for works that are to be consumed, even in part, online.

Consult with your editor if rights holders ask for a specific number of print copies for which they are also ultimately granting permission. Your editor will be able to provide you a ballpark number as well as alert you to any possible complications that may arise from their print-on-demand (POD) strategy.

### Review Agreements
Review the language in all the permission agreements you receive; keep in mind that most publishers require nonexclusive **world rights** in **all languages** *and* **formats** in order to distribute your book outside of the United States and to arrange for possible translations. Alert your publisher to any term limits placed on the material.

### List of Material
Provide a detailed list of all previously published chapters, including:
* which chapters have been previously published and complete publication citations for these articles;
* whether the material has been revised and if so, exactly how it differs from the original work. This information is critical in determining whether permission needs to be sought;
* whether you or the publisher controls the right to reprint. If you believe that you hold the rights, substantiate this with a copy of your contract for the previous publication. It is not enough that material is copyrighted in your name. Authors are often given the right to reprint their material in a second work written or edited by the author. This does not allow material to be reprinted in an edited collection by someone else without permission.

<!-- THIS MAY BE A BIT MUCH
All abstracted materials you or your co-authors did not personally create will need to be accounted for on the [permission log](permission-log.md/). Even those that are in the public domain should appear here to form a complete record of the project's assets.
