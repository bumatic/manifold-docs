# Publishers

Manifold provides news means for publishers to showcase the work of their authors. This section of the documentation provides a pragmatic walkthrough of the [different types of publications](project_types.md) Manifold makes available and how those can be worked into a publisherâ€™s [existing workflow](workflow.md).

In the coming weeks, we will be adding sections to this space describing in detail how publishers interface with the back end of the system, where projects and user accounts are created, text and resources are added, and system preferences are adjusted.
